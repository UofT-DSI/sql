-- COALESCE
/* 1. Our favourite manager wants a detailed long list of products, but is afraid of tables! 
We tell them, no problem! We can produce a list with all of the appropriate details. 

Using the following syntax you create our super cool and not at all needy manager a list:

SELECT 
product_name || ', ' || product_size|| ' (' || product_qty_type || ')'
FROM product

But wait! The product table has some bad data (a few NULL values). 
Find the NULLs and then using COALESCE, replace the NULL with a 
blank for the first problem, and 'unit' for the second problem. 

HINT: keep the syntax the same, but edited the correct components with the string. 
The `||` values concatenate the columns into strings. 
Edit the appropriate columns -- you're making two edits -- and the NULL rows will be fixed. 
All the other rows will remain the same.) */

COALESCE(product_name, '') || ', ' || COALESCE(product_size, '') || ' (' || COALESCE(product_qty_type, '') || ')'
FROM product;
SELECT 
COALESCE(product_name, '') || ', ' || COALESCE(product_size, '') || ' (' || COALESCE(product_qty_type, 'unit') || ')'

You can either display all rows in the customer_purchases table, with the counter changing on

-- String manipulations
/* 1. Some product names in the product table have descriptions like "Jar" or "Organic". 
These are separated from the product name with a hyphen. 
Create a column using SUBSTR (and a couple of other commands) that captures these, but is otherwise NULL. 
Remove any trailing or leading whitespaces. Don't just use a case statement for each product! 

| product_name               | description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| Habanero Peppers - Organic | Organic     |

Hint: you might need to use INSTR(product_name,'-') to find the hyphens. INSTR will help split the column. */

-- UNION
/* 1. Using a UNION, write a query that displays the market dates with the highest and lowest total sales.

HINT: There are a possibly a few ways to do this query, but if you're struggling, try the following: 
1) Create a CTE/Temp Table to find sales values grouped dates; 
2) Create another CTE/Temp table with a rank windowed function on the previous query to create 
"best day" and "worst day"; 
3) Query the second temp table twice, once for the best day, once for the worst day, 
with a UNION binding them. */
