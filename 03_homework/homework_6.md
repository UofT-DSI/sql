**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.


I have worked on a literature and Bioinformatics scientific research on the protein RPRM, the gene for which is thought to be involved as a possible tumor suppressor gene. I explored nucleotide and gene sequence of the RORM and RPRM-like genes using expression databases like GenBank, ENA, DDBJ, EGA,TCGA and Uniprot. I also studied protein interactions using protein-protein interaction databases like STRING, Reactome, BioGrid etc. I also used softwares like AlphaFold and bioinformatics tools like Pfam, Cytoscape, PyMOL and dbPTM to comprehend the post-translational modifications of the proteins to analyze its tumor suppressive properties. Although the available data and structures were open to everyone for use and in the future too I would be mindful to utilise the data available in the best way possible to avoid accessing areas that I am not supposed to. This would help protect the privacy and confidentiality of the data.
