**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Reflecting on our previous work, I think we could handle Data security,data privacy and Compliance better.

For data compliance and to make our changes more understandable,wWe could include more Documentation to indicate what the query does and any new table transformations that were made.It would also be a good practice to include data for Audit trails like a timestamp of when any new columns or data was added.

To ensure data privacy,I think that we should have used customer ID instead of the actual names where possible to protect customer privacy.We could also use data encryption for any sensitive user information.

In terms of the data retention, we should have queries to ensure that the data is retained only for the agreed amount of time on our systems for new/existing tables.

Also, we should have controlled access to the data(tables) to ensure data security
