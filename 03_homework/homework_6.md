**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.


When reflecting on previous work, it's definitely need to include ethics and fairness in database management and SQL queries. I remember working in finance sector (bank) and there was focus on keeping people's data safe. Our company were using strong security measures like encryption and access controls. Not everyone had access to a certain tables and it was regulated who can access and modify existing data and database structure. Also there were implemented system of logging and monitoring, so it was under control.

As far as I know the ethical aspects of data are many. For example,Â defining ownership of data, obtaining consent to collect and share data, protecting the identity of human subjects and their personal identifying information, and the licensing of data. Being involved in work related to the data is always a high responsibility for everyone.
