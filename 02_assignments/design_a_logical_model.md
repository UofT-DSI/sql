# Assignment 1: Design a Logical Model

## Question 1
Create a logical model for a small bookstore. ðŸ“š

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. Include a date table. There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [_Draw.io_](https://www.drawio.com/) or [_LucidChart_](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

## Question 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

## Question 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2?

_Hint, search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions._

Bonus: Are there privacy implications to this, why or why not?
```
Your answer...
```
Type 1 SCD  Overwrite Changes 
The CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table overwrites the existing address whenever there is an update. Historical addresses are not retained, and only the current address is stored.

This design minimizes the amount of personal information stored, as only the current address is kept. This can be beneficial for privacy as it reduces the risk of exposure of historical addresses in the event of a data breach.
However, it does not provide a history of address changes, which can be a drawback if historical address information is needed for business purposes or legal compliance.

Type 2 SCD Retain Changes
The CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table retains historical addresses by adding a new record each time an address changes. 

This design stores a complete history of address changes, which can be valuable for customer service and compliance purposes.
However, retaining historical address data increases the amount of personal information stored, which can heighten privacy risks.

## Question 4
Review the AdventureWorks Schema [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LMu4W.gif)

Highlight at least two differences between it and your ERD. Would you change anything in yours?
```
Your answer...
```
AdventureWorks provides a robust and detailed schema that exemplifies best practices in database design, such as high normalization and comprehensive historical tracking. 

Difference 1: Scope
AdventureWorks: Extensive and highly detailed, with separate tables for distinct aspects of business operations, reflecting real-world complexity. Separate tables for different attributes. Highly normalized with multiple related tables for each entity. 
Bookstore ERD: More simplified with fewer tables and combined data fields to ease implementation. For example: Customer table combining customer and email and phone number without historical tracking for the email and phone number.

Difference 2: Historical Data Tracking
AdventureWorks: Implements Type 2 SCD to track historical data, maintaining comprehensive records of changes over time.
Bookstore ERD: Type 1 SCD. It lacks mechanisms to retain historical data and updates that overwrite previous information.
