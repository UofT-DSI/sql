# Assignment 1: Design a Logical Model

## Question 1
Create a logical model for a small bookstore. ðŸ“š

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. Include a date table. There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [_Draw.io_](https://www.drawio.com/) or [_LucidChart_](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

## Question 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

## Question 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2?

_Hint, search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions._

Bonus: Are there privacy implications to this, why or why not?

A: For retaining changes, we should use Type 2 SCD with additional columns for start and end dates to track changes. For overwriting changes, we have to use Type 1 SCD by simply updating the existing record. Both have privacy implications as they involve storing sensitive customer data, requiring compliance with privacy regulations and robust security measures.

## Question 4
Review the AdventureWorks Schema [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LMu4W.gif)

Highlight at least two differences between it and your ERD. Would you change anything in yours?

A: We can clearly see a smart implementation in the AdventureWorks schema where AddressID is linked to StateProvinceID for determining tax rates, which is a great approach for online sales. Additionally, the employee table is rich in detail but lacks names. It's keyed to Person on BusinessEntityID, with Person capturing various salutation components. Unlike my ERD, AdventureWorks tracks additional details like shifts, job titles, hire dates, salaried status, and types of paid time off. I'd consider adopting these elements.
