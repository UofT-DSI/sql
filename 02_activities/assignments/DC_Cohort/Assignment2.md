## Section 1:
You can start this section following *session 1*, but you may want to wait until you feel comfortable wtih basic SQL query writing. 

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Design a logical data model
- Duplicate the logical data model and add another table to it following the instructions
- Write, within this markdown file, an answer to Prompt 3


###  Design a Logical Model

#### Prompt 1
Design a logical model for a small bookstore. 📚

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. 

Additionally, include a date table. 
A date table (also called a calendar table) is a permanent table containing a list of dates and various components of those dates. Some theory, tips, and commentary can be found [here](https://www.sqlshack.com/designing-a-calendar-table/), [here](https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/4054/creating-a-date-dimension-or-calendar-table-in-sql-server/) and [here](https://sqlgeekspro.com/creating-calendar-table-sql-server/). 
Remember, you don't actually need to run any of the queries in these articles, but instead understand *why* date tables in SQL make sense, and how to situate them within your logical models.

There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) or [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

**HINT:** You do not need to create any data for this prompt. This is a conceptual model only. 

#### Prompt 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

#### Prompt 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2? 

**HINT:** search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions. 

```
To store customer addresses, two different architectures can be used depending on whether historical changes need to be preserved.

**Option 1: Overwrite (Type 1 SCD)**

In this approach, the customer_address table stores only the most recent address for each customer. When a customer updates their address, the existing record is overwritten.

Structure example:
customer_address
- address_id (PK)
- customer_id (FK)
- street
- city
- province
- postal_code
- country
By doing this:
- Each customer has only one current address
- No history of previous addresses is stored
- This approach is simple and efficient, but loses past data
→ This is Slowly Changing Dimension Type 1, as it replaces old values with new ones.

**Option 2: Historical Tracking (Type 2 SCD)**

In this approach, a new row is inserted whenever a customer’s address changes, allowing historical records to be preserved.

Structure example:
customer_address
- address_id (PK)
- customer_id (FK)
- street
- city
- province
- postal_code
- country
- valid_from (DATE)
- valid_to (DATE)
- is_current (BOOLEAN)

By doing this:
- A customer can have multiple address records over time
- Only one record is marked as current (is_current = TRUE)
- Previous addresses are retained for historical analysis
→ This is Slowly Changing Dimension Type 2, as it preserves changes by adding new records instead of overwriting.
```

## Section 2:
You can start this section following *session 4*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Open the assignment2.sql file in DB Browser for SQLite:
	- from [Github](./02_activities/assignments/assignment2.sql)
	- or, from your local forked repository  
- Complete each question, by writing responses between the QUERY # and END QUERY blocks


### Write SQL

#### COALESCE
1. Our favourite manager wants a detailed long list of products, but is afraid of tables! We tell them, no problem! We can produce a list with all of the appropriate details. 

Using the following syntax you create our super cool and not at all needy manager a list:
```
SELECT 
product_name || ', ' || product_size|| ' (' || product_qty_type || ')'
FROM product
```

But wait! The product table has some bad data (a few NULL values). 
Find the NULLs and then using COALESCE, replace the NULL with a blank for the first column with nulls, and 'unit' for the second column with nulls. 

**HINT**: keep the syntax the same, but edited the correct components with the string. The `||` values concatenate the columns into strings. Edit the appropriate columns -- you're making two edits -- and the NULL rows will be fixed. All the other rows will remain the same.

<div align="center">-</div>

#### Windowed Functions
1. Write a query that selects from the customer_purchases table and numbers each customer’s visits to the farmer’s market (labeling each market date with a different number). Each customer’s first visit is labeled 1, second visit is labeled 2, etc. 

You can either display all rows in the customer_purchases table, with the counter changing on each new market date for each customer, or select only the unique market dates per customer (without purchase details) and number those visits. 

**HINT**: One of these approaches uses ROW_NUMBER() and one uses DENSE_RANK().

Filter the visits to dates before April 29, 2022.

2. Reverse the numbering of the query so each customer’s most recent visit is labeled 1, then write another query that uses this one as a subquery (or temp table) and filters the results to only the customer’s most recent visit. 
**HINT**: Do not use the previous visit dates filter.

3. Using a COUNT() window function, include a value along with each row of the customer_purchases table that indicates how many different times that customer has purchased that product_id.

You can make this a running count by including an ORDER BY within the PARTITION BY if desired.
Filter the visits to dates before April 29, 2022.

<div align="center">-</div>

#### String manipulations
1. Some product names in the product table have descriptions like "Jar" or "Organic". These are separated from the product name with a hyphen. Create a column using SUBSTR (and a couple of other commands) that captures these, but is otherwise NULL. Remove any trailing or leading whitespaces. Don't just use a case statement for each product! 

| product_name               | description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| Habanero Peppers - Organic | Organic     |

**HINT**: you might need to use INSTR(product_name,'-') to find the hyphens. INSTR will help split the column. 

2. Filter the query to show any product_size value that contain a number with REGEXP. 

<div align="center">-</div>

#### UNION
1. Using a UNION, write a query that displays the market dates with the highest and lowest total sales.

**HINT**: There are a possibly a few ways to do this query, but if you're struggling, try the following: 1) Create a CTE/Temp Table to find sales values grouped dates; 2) Create another CTE/Temp table with a rank windowed function on the previous query to create "best day" and "worst day"; 3) Query the second temp table twice, once for the best day, once for the worst day, with a UNION binding them.

## Section 3:
You can start this section following *session 5*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Open the assignment2.sql file in DB Browser for SQLite:
	- from [Github](./02_activities/assignments/assignment2.sql)
	- or, from your local forked repository  
- Complete each question, by writing responses between the QUERY # and END QUERY blocks

### Write SQL

#### Cross Join
1. Suppose every vendor in the `vendor_inventory` table had 5 of each of their products to sell to **every** customer on record. How much money would each vendor make per product? Show this by vendor_name and product name, rather than using the IDs.

**HINT**: Be sure you select only relevant columns and rows. Remember, CROSS JOIN will explode your table rows, so CROSS JOIN should likely be a subquery. Think a bit about the row counts: how many distinct vendors, product names are there (x)? How many customers are there (y). Before your final group by you should have the product of those two queries (x\*y). 

<div align="center">-</div>

#### INSERT
1. Create a new table "product_units". This table will contain only products where the `product_qty_type = 'unit'`. It should use all of the columns from the product table, as well as a new column for the `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`.  Name the timestamp column `snapshot_timestamp`.

2. Using `INSERT`, add a new row to the product_unit table (with an updated timestamp). This can be any product you desire (e.g. add another record for Apple Pie). 

<div align="center">-</div>

#### DELETE 
1. Delete the older record for the whatever product you added.

**HINT**: If you don't specify a WHERE clause, [you are going to have a bad time](https://imgflip.com/i/8iq872).

<div align="center">-</div>

#### UPDATE
1. We want to add the current_quantity to the product_units table. First, add a new column, `current_quantity` to the table using the following syntax.
```
ALTER TABLE product_units
ADD current_quantity INT;
```

Then, using `UPDATE`, change the current_quantity equal to the **last** `quantity` value from the vendor_inventory details. 

**HINT**: This one is pretty hard. First, determine how to get the "last" quantity per product. Second, coalesce null values to 0 (if you don't have null values, figure out how to rearrange your query so you do.) Third, `SET current_quantity = (...your select statement...)`, remembering that WHERE can only accommodate one column. Finally, make sure you have a WHERE statement to update the right row, you'll need to use `product_units.product_id` to refer to the correct row within the product_units table. When you have all of these components, you can run the update statement.

### Ethics

Read: Boykis, V. (2019, October 16). _Neural nets are just people all the way down._ Normcore Tech. <br>
    https://vicki.substack.com/p/neural-nets-are-just-people-all-the

**What are some of the ethical issues important to this story?**

Consider, for example, concepts of labour, bias, LLM proliferation, moderating content, intersection of technology and society, ect. 


```
Vicki Boykis’ article pushes back against the idea that AI systems are somehow independent or objective. Instead, she shows that behind every “intelligent” system are layers of human decisions, labor, and judgment. This perspective brings up several important ethical concerns.
One of the most striking issues is labor. AI systems depend heavily on large amounts of labeled data, and this work is often done by low-paid workers whose contributions are largely invisible. While AI is often described as automation, it actually relies on a hidden workforce to function. This raises questions about fairness, working conditions, and who really benefits from these technologies.
Another key issue is bias. Since both the data and the models are shaped by people, they inevitably reflect human assumptions and limitations. Decisions about what data to include, how to label it, and what counts as a “correct” output are all subjective. As a result, AI systems can reinforce existing inequalities, even if that was not the intention.
The article also highlights how responsibility can become blurred. When outcomes are attributed to “the algorithm,” it becomes easy to overlook the people who designed and trained it. This can make it harder to hold anyone accountable when things go wrong, such as when systems produce biased or harmful results.
Finally, as AI systems like large language models become more widespread, their influence on society grows. They shape how information is created, shared, and moderated, which raises concerns about misinformation and control over public discourse.
In general, the article reminds us that AI is not separate from society. It reflects human choices at every level, and understanding this is essential if we want to address its ethical implications.
