## Section 1:
You can start this section following *session 1*, but you may want to wait until you feel comfortable wtih basic SQL query writing. 

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Design a logical data model
- Duplicate the logical data model and add another table to it following the instructions
- Write, within this markdown file, an answer to Prompt 3


###  Design a Logical Model

#### Prompt 1
Design a logical model for a small bookstore. ðŸ“š

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. 

Additionally, include a date table. 

There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) or [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

**HINT:** You do not need to create any data for this prompt. This is a conceptual model only. 

#### Prompt 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

#### Prompt 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2? 

**HINT:** search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions. 

```

```

Type 1 SCD â€“ customer_addresses overwrite
Customer_id
Address line 1
Address line 2
City
State/Province
Country
Postal Code


Type 2 SCD â€“ customer_addresses retain changes
Customer_id
Address_id
Address line 1
Address line 2
City
State/Province
Country
Postal Code
Start_date
End_date


The architecture that overwrites the customer addresses is the type 1 slowly changing dimension. The architecture that retain changes is the type 2 slowly changing dimension.

## Section 2:
You can start this section following *session 4*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Open the assignment2.sql file in DB Browser for SQLite:
	- from [Github](./02_activities/assignments/assignment2.sql)
	- or, from your local forked repository  
- Complete each question


### Write SQL

#### COALESCE
1. Our favourite manager wants a detailed long list of products, but is afraid of tables! We tell them, no problem! We can produce a list with all of the appropriate details. 

Using the following syntax you create our super cool and not at all needy manager a list:
```
SELECT 
product_name || ', ' || product_size|| ' (' || product_qty_type || ')'
FROM product
```

But wait! The product table has some bad data (a few NULL values). 
Find the NULLs and then using COALESCE, replace the NULL with a blank for the first problem, and 'unit' for the second problem. 

**HINT**: keep the syntax the same, but edited the correct components with the string. The `||` values concatenate the columns into strings. Edit the appropriate columns -- you're making two edits -- and the NULL rows will be fixed. All the other rows will remain the same.


SELECT 
product_name || ', ' ||COALESCE (product_size,'')|| ' (' || COALESCE (product_qty_type,'unit') || ')'
FROM product;


<div align="center">-</div>

#### Windowed Functions
1. Write a query that selects from the customer_purchases table and numbers each customerâ€™s visits to the farmerâ€™s market (labeling each market date with a different number). Each customerâ€™s first visit is labeled 1, second visit is labeled 2, etc. 

You can either display all rows in the customer_purchases table, with the counter changing on each new market date for each customer, or select only the unique market dates per customer (without purchase details) and number those visits. 

**HINT**: One of these approaches uses ROW_NUMBER() and one uses DENSE_RANK().

SELECT 
    customer_id,
    market_date,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
        PARTITION BY customer_id 
        ORDER BY market_date
    ) AS visit_number
FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT customer_id, market_date 
    FROM customer_purchases
) unique_visits;

2. Reverse the numbering of the query from a part so each customerâ€™s most recent visit is labeled 1, then write another query that uses this one as a subquery (or temp table) and filters the results to only the customerâ€™s most recent visit.

WITH RecentVisits AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        market_date,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY customer_id 
            ORDER BY market_date DESC
        ) AS visit_number
    FROM ( 
        SELECT DISTINCT customer_id, market_date 
        FROM customer_purchases
    ) AS unique_visits  -- Added alias here
)
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    market_date
FROM RecentVisits
WHERE visit_number = 1;


3. Using a COUNT() window function, include a value along with each row of the customer_purchases table that indicates how many different times that customer has purchased that product_id.

SELECT DISTINCT
    customer_id,
    product_id,
    COUNT(*) OVER (
        PARTITION BY customer_id,product_id
    ) AS purchase_count
FROM customer_purchases;


<div align="center">-</div>

#### String manipulations
1. Some product names in the product table have descriptions like "Jar" or "Organic". These are separated from the product name with a hyphen. Create a column using SUBSTR (and a couple of other commands) that captures these, but is otherwise NULL. Remove any trailing or leading whitespaces. Don't just use a case statement for each product! 

| product_name               | description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| Habanero Peppers - Organic | Organic     |

**HINT**: you might need to use INSTR(product_name,'-') to find the hyphens. INSTR will help split the column. 



<div align="center">-</div>

#### UNION
1. Using a UNION, write a query that displays the market dates with the highest and lowest total sales.

**HINT**: There are a possibly a few ways to do this query, but if you're struggling, try the following: 1) Create a CTE/Temp Table to find sales values grouped dates; 2) Create another CTE/Temp table with a rank windowed function on the previous query to create "best day" and "worst day"; 3) Query the second temp table twice, once for the best day, once for the worst day, with a UNION binding them. 

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS sales_by_market_date; 

CREATE TEMP TABLE sales_by_market_date AS
SELECT 
    market_date, 
    SUM(sales) AS total_sales 
FROM vendor_daily_sales
GROUP BY market_date; 


SELECT *
,RANK() OVER(ORDER BY total_sales DESC) as [rank]

FROM sales_by_market_date

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS best_day;

CREATE TEMP TABLE best_day AS
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT 
        market_date, 
        total_sales, 
        RANK() OVER(ORDER BY total_sales DESC) AS sales_rank
    FROM sales_by_market_date
) x
WHERE sales_rank = 1;


DROP TABLE IF EXISTS highest_and_lowest_sales;

CREATE TEMP TABLE highest_and_lowest_sales AS
SELECT market_date, total_sales, 'Best Day' AS category
FROM temp.best_day

UNION

SELECT market_date, total_sales, 'Worst Day' AS category
FROM temp.worst_day;

## Section 3:
You can start this section following *session 5*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Open the assignment2.sql file in DB Browser for SQLite:
	- from [Github](./02_activities/assignments/assignment2.sql)
	- or, from your local forked repository  
- Complete each question

### Write SQL

#### Cross Join
1. Suppose every vendor in the `vendor_inventory` table had 5 of each of their products to sell to **every** customer on record. How much money would each vendor make per product? Show this by vendor_name and product name, rather than using the IDs.

**HINT**: Be sure you select only relevant columns and rows. Remember, CROSS JOIN will explode your table rows, so CROSS JOIN should likely be a subquery. Think a bit about the row counts: how many distinct vendors, product names are there (x)? How many customers are there (y). Before your final group by you should have the product of those two queries (x\*y). 

WITH customer_count AS (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_customers FROM customer
)

SELECT 
    v.vendor_name,
    p.product_name,
    (5 * cc.total_customers * vi.original_price) AS total_revenue
FROM vendor_inventory vi
JOIN vendor v ON vi.vendor_id = v.vendor_id
JOIN product p ON vi.product_id = p.product_id
CROSS JOIN customer_count cc
GROUP BY v.vendor_name, p.product_name;



<div align="center">-</div>

#### INSERT
1. Create a new table "product_units". This table will contain only products where the `product_qty_type = 'unit'`. It should use all of the columns from the product table, as well as a new column for the `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`.  Name the timestamp column `snapshot_timestamp`.

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS product_units;
CREATE TEMP TABLE product_units AS
	SELECT *,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS Snapshot_timestamp
	FROM product
	WHERE product_qty_type = 'unit'



2. Using `INSERT`, add a new row to the product_unit table (with an updated timestamp). This can be any product you desire (e.g. add another record for Apple Pie). 

INSERT INTO product_units
VALUES(26,'Mango Pie','10"',8,'unit',CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );
SELECT * FROM product_units
	

<div align="center">-</div>

#### DELETE 
1. Delete the older record for the whatever product you added.

**HINT**: If you don't specify a WHERE clause, [you are going to have a bad time](https://imgflip.com/i/8iq872).


DELETE FROM product_units
WHERE product_id=26;



<div align="center">-</div>

#### UPDATE
1. We want to add the current_quantity to the product_units table. First, add a new column, `current_quantity` to the table using the following syntax.
```
ALTER TABLE product_units
ADD current_quantity INT;
```

Then, using `UPDATE`, change the current_quantity equal to the **last** `quantity` value from the vendor_inventory details. 

**HINT**: This one is pretty hard. First, determine how to get the "last" quantity per product. Second, coalesce null values to 0 (if you don't have null values, figure out how to rearrange your query so you do.) Third, `SET current_quantity = (...your select statement...)`, remembering that WHERE can only accommodate one column. Finally, make sure you have a WHERE statement to update the right row, you'll need to use `product_units.product_id` to refer to the correct row within the product_units table. When you have all of these components, you can run the update statement.
