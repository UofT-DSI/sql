/* 1. Products can be sold by the individual unit or by bulk measures like lbs. or oz. 
Using the product table, write a query that outputs the product_id and product_name
columns and add a column called prod_qty_type_condensed that displays the word “unit” 
if the product_qty_type is “unit,” and otherwise displays the word “bulk.” */
--QUERY 5




--END QUERY


/* 2. We want to flag all of the different types of pepper products that are sold at the market. 
add a column to the previous query called pepper_flag that outputs a 1 if the product_name 
contains the word “pepper” (regardless of capitalization), and otherwise outputs 0. */
--QUERY 6




--END QUERY


--JOIN
/* 1. Write a query that INNER JOINs the vendor table to the vendor_booth_assignments table on the 
vendor_id field they both have in common, and sorts the result by market_date, then vendor_name.
Limit to 24 rows of output. */

--END QUERY



/* SECTION 3 */

-- AGGREGATE

--QUERY 8




--END QUERY


/* 2. The Farmer’s Market Customer Appreciation Committee wants to give a bumper 
sticker to everyone who has ever spent more than $2000 at the market. Write a query that generates a list 
of customers for them to give stickers to, sorted by last name, then first name. 

HINT: This query requires you to join two tables, use an aggregate function, and use the HAVING keyword. */
--QUERY 9




--END QUERY


--Temp Table
/* 1. Insert the original vendor table into a temp.new_vendor and then add a 10th vendor: 
Thomass Superfood Store, a Fresh Focused store, owned by Thomas Rosenthal

HINT: This is two total queries -- first create the table from the original, then insert the new 10th vendor. 
When inserting the new vendor, you need to appropriately align the columns to be inserted 
(there are five columns to be inserted, I've given you the details, but not the syntax) 

-> To insert the new row use VALUES, specifying the value you want for each column:
VALUES(col1,col2,col3,col4,col5) 
*/
--QUERY 10




--END QUERY


-- Date
/*1. Get the customer_id, month, and year (in separate columns) of every purchase in the customer_purchases table.

HINT: you might need to search for strfrtime modifers sqlite on the web to know what the modifers for month 
and year are! 
Limit to 25 rows of output. */
--QUERY 11




--END QUERY


/* 2. Using the previous query as a base, determine how much money each customer spent in April 2022. 
Remember that money spent is quantity*cost_to_customer_per_qty. 

HINTS: you will need to AGGREGATE, GROUP BY, and filter...
but remember, STRFTIME returns a STRING for your WHERE statement...
AND be sure you remove the LIMIT from the previous query before aggregating!! */
