## Section 1:
You can start this section following *session 1*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Load the farmersmarket.db and browse its content
- Create a logical data model

<br>
If this is your first time in DB Browser for SQLite, the following instructions may help:

#### 1) Load Database
- Open DB Browser for SQLite
- Go to File > Open Database
- Navigate to your farmersmarket.db 
	- This will be wherever you cloned the GH Repo (within the **SQL** folder)
	- ![db_browser_for_sqlite_choose_db.png](./images/01_db_browser_for_sqlite_choose_db.png)

#### 2) Configure your windows
By default, DB Browser for SQLite has three windows, with four tabs in the main window and three tabs in the bottom right window
- Window 1: Main Window (Centre)
	- Stay in the Database Structure tab for now
- Window 2: Edit Database Cell (Top Right)
- Window 3: Remote (Bottom Right)
	- Switch this to DB Schema tab (very bottom)

Your screen should look like this (or very similar)
![db_browser_for_sqlite.png](./images/01_db_browser_for_sqlite.png)

#### 3) The farmersmarket.db
There are 10 tables in the Main Window:
1) booth
2) customer
3) customer_purchases
4) market_date_info
5) product
6) product_category
7) vendor
8) vendor_booth_assignments
9) vendor_inventory
10) zip_data

Switch to the Browse Data tab, booth is selected by default

<img src="./images/01_the_browse_data_tab.png" width="900">


Using the table drop down at the top left, explore some of the contents of the database

<img src="./images/01_the_table_drop_down_at_the_top_left.png" width="200">

Move on to the Logical Data Model task when you have looked through the tables


### Build Logical Data Model

Recall during session 1:

I diagramed the following four tables:
- product
- product_category
- vendor
- vendor_inventory

 <img src="./images/01_farmers_market_logical_model_partial.png" width="500">


#### Prompt 1:
Choose two tables and create a logical data model. There are lots of tools you can do this (including drawing this by hand), but I'd recommend [Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) or [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/). 

A logical data model must contain:
- table name
- column names
- relationship type

Please do not pick the exact same tables that I have already diagrammed. For example, you shouldn't diagram the relationship between `product` and `product_category`, but you could diagram `product` and `customer_purchases`.

**HINTS**:
- You will need to use the Browse Data tab in the main window to figure out the relationship types.
- You can't diagram tables that don't share a common column
	- These are the tables that are connected
	- <img src="./images/01_farmers_market_conceptual_model.png" width="600">
- The column names can be found in a few spots (DB Schema window in the bottom right, the Database Structure tab in the main window by expanding each table entry, at the top of the Browse Data tab in the main window)

## Section 2:
You can start this section following *session 2*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Open the assignment1.sql file in DB Browser for SQLite:
	- from [Github](./02_activities/assignments/assignment1.sql)
	- or, from your local forked repository  
- Complete each question

### Write SQL

#### SELECT
1. Write a query that returns everything in the customer table.
Select * from customer



2. Write a query that displays all of the columns and 10 rows from the customer table, sorted by customer_last_name, then customer_first_ name.

SELECT * 
FROM customer 
ORDER BY customer_last_name ASC, customer_first_name ASC
LIMIT 10

<div align="center">-</div>

#### WHERE
1. Write a query that returns all customer purchases of product IDs 4 and 9.

SELECT *
FROM customer_purchases
WHERE product_id in('4','9')

2. Write a query that returns all customer purchases and a new calculated column 'price' (quantity * cost_to_customer_per_qty), filtered by vendor IDs between 8 and 10 (inclusive) using either:
	1.  two conditions using AND
	2.  one condition using BETWEEN

SELECT *
,quantity*cost_to_customer_per_qty as price
FROM customer_purchases
WHERE vendor_id BETWEEN 8 and 10

<div align="center">-</div>

#### CASE
1. Products can be sold by the individual unit or by bulk measures like lbs. or oz. Using the product table, write a query that outputs the `product_id` and `product_name` columns and add a column called `prod_qty_type_condensed` that displays the word ‚Äúunit‚Äù if the `product_qty_type` is ‚Äúunit,‚Äù and otherwise displays the word ‚Äúbulk.‚Äù

SELECT product_id, product_name,
CASE WHEN product_qty_type = 'unit'
THEN 'unit'
ELSE 'bulk'
END as prod_qty_type_condensed
FROM product



2. We want to flag all of the different types of pepper products that are sold at the market. Add a column to the previous query called `pepper_flag` that outputs a 1 if the product_name contains the word ‚Äúpepper‚Äù (regardless of capitalization), and otherwise outputs 0.

SELECT 
    product_id, 
    product_name,
    CASE 
        WHEN product_qty_type = 'unit' THEN 'unit'
        ELSE 'bulk'
    END AS prod_qty_type_condensed,
    CASE 
        WHEN LOWER(product_name) LIKE '%pepper%' THEN 1
        ELSE 0
    END AS pepper_flag
FROM product



<div align="center">-</div>

#### JOIN
1. Write a query that `INNER JOIN`s the `vendor` table to the `vendor_booth_assignments` table on the `vendor_id` field they both have in common, and sorts the result by `vendor_name`, then `market_date`.


SELECT *
FROM 
    vendor AS v
INNER JOIN 
    vendor_booth_assignments AS vba
ON 
    v.vendor_id = vba.vendor_id
ORDER BY 
    v.vendor_name ASC, 
    vba.market_date ASC;

***

## Section 3:
You can start this section following *session 3*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Open the assignment1.sql file in DB Browser for SQLite:
	- from [Github](./02_activities/assignments/assignment1.sql)
	- or, from your local forked repository  
- Complete each question

### Write SQL

#### AGGREGATE
1. Write a query that determines how many times each vendor has rented a booth at the farmer‚Äôs market by counting the vendor booth assignments per `vendor_id`.

SELECT 
    v.vendor_id, 
    COUNT(vba.booth_number) AS booth_assignment_count
FROM 
    vendor AS v
INNER JOIN 
    vendor_booth_assignments AS vba
ON 
    v.vendor_id = vba.vendor_id
GROUP BY 
    v.vendor_id
ORDER BY 
    v.vendor_id ASC;


2. The Farmer‚Äôs Market Customer Appreciation Committee wants to give a bumper sticker to everyone who has ever spent more than $2000 at the market. Write a query that generates a list of customers for them to give stickers to, sorted by last name, then first name.
   
**HINT**: This query requires you to join two tables, use an aggregate function, and use the HAVING keyword.


SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_first_name,
    c.customer_last_name,
    SUM(cp.quantity * cp.cost_to_customer_per_qty) AS total_spent
FROM 
    customer AS c
INNER JOIN 
    customer_purchases AS cp
ON 
    c.customer_id = cp.customer_id
GROUP BY 
    c.customer_id, c.customer_first_name, c.customer_last_name
HAVING 
    total_spent > 2000
ORDER BY 
    c.customer_last_name ASC, c.customer_first_name ASC;


<div align="center">-</div>

#### Temp Table
1. Insert the original vendor table into a temp.new_vendor and then add a 10th vendor: Thomass Superfood Store, a Fresh Focused store, owned by Thomas Rosenthal
   
**HINT**: This is two total queries -- first create the table from the original, then insert the new 10th vendor. When inserting the new vendor, you need to appropriately align the columns to be inserted (there are five columns to be inserted, I've given you the details, but not the syntax)

To insert the new row use VALUES, specifying the value you want for each column:  
`VALUES(col1,col2,col3,col4,col5)`


CREATE TABLE temp.new_vendor AS
SELECT * FROM vendor;

INSERT INTO temp.new_vendor (vendor_id, vendor_name, vendor_type, vendor_owner_first_name, vendor_owner_last_name)
VALUES (10, 'Thomas''s Superfood Store', 'Fresh Focused', 'Thomas', 'Rosenthal');



<div align="center">-</div>

#### Date
1. Get the customer_id, month, and year (in separate columns) of every purchase in the customer_purchases table.
   
**HINT**: you might need to search for strfrtime modifers sqlite on the web to know what the modifers for month and year are!


SELECT 
    customer_id,
    strftime('%m', market_date) AS purchase_month,
    strftime('%Y', market_date) AS purchase_year
FROM 
    customer_purchases;


2. Using the previous query as a base, determine how much money each customer spent in April 2022. Remember that money spent is `quantity*cost_to_customer_per_qty`.
   
**HINTS**: you will need to AGGREGATE, GROUP BY, and filter...but remember, STRFTIME returns a STRING for your WHERE statement!!

SELECT 
    customer_id,
    SUM(quantity * cost_to_customer_per_qty) AS total_spent
FROM 
    customer_purchases
WHERE 
    strftime('%m', market_date) = '04' AND strftime('%Y', market_date) = '2022'
GROUP BY 
    customer_id;

**What values systems are embedded in databases and data systems you encounter in your day-to-day life?**

Consider, for example, concepts of fariness, inequality, social structures, marginalization, intersection of technology and society, etc.


```
Your thoughts...
```

Databases and data systems can inherently reflect the values and biases of their creators and the societies they serve. Although digitalization of data aims to create unbiased data handling, inequalities still are embedded in databases and data systems ‚Äì not because of how the data is processed, but because of the lack of fairness, equity and inclusivity within the data itself. One inherent bias that results in inequalities is the reliance on outdated data, which may no longer accurately represent the current context. For example, liver transplantation is critical for patients with end-stage liver disease. However, current transplant waitlist systems embed inequities regarding patient selection, particularly for women, older people, and those with some advanced conditions such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or cholestatic liver disease. The current scoring systems that were developed around twenty years ago help doctors rank patients on the transplant waitlist based on who should receive a liver first. It acts as a guideline to prioritize individuals based on their medical need and the urgency of their condition. However, over the years, the population of patients needing liver transplants has evolved. For instance, there has been a decline in patients with hepatitis-related liver diseases, while the number of patients with conditions such as NASH or cholestatic liver disease has increased. Additionally, the aging population, often with co-morbidities, presents greater challenges in eligibility and prioritization for transplants. Consequently, the scoring systems, which were calibrated for an earlier population, no longer performs as effectively for the current patient population. 
Ideally, systems should represent a wide range of populations and contexts. In practice, underrepresented groups may be excluded due to biases in data collection. For example, ChatGPT supports a wide range of languages. However, it provides the most accurate results in the English language setting. This is likely because of the English dominance of the training data for ChatGPT, and the language that the human evaluator used to provide feedback is likely to be English. Such data source bias creates inequalities to non-English users, as the underrepresentation of minority languages in ChatGPT‚Äôs training data can lead to poor understanding and lower quality responses. 
While data systems and databases aim to provide unbiased solutions, the lack of fairness, equity and inclusivity within the data itself often lead to the marginalization of certain groups or the prioritization of others. Acknowledging these embedded values is the first step toward creating systems that are more inclusive to diverse needs.
