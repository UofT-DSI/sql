**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.


Ethics and inequity components in my previous work experience as a marketing manager in a digital marketing agency would be related to account management and project management. Being more affiliated with certain clients, it was challenginng to provide an equal amount of services to all clients.

To ensure equal treatment of clients, a limit of working hours per month was set on each project. The communication with clients and monthly reports had to be standardized.

While writing content for our client's websites, it was extremely important to follow ethical guidelines for every industry and for online marketing in general (communication standards, protocols for email campaigns to tule out spam flags and complaints, standards for collecting and using client's information, ruling out SEO practices aimed at harming the competitors, copyright and plagiarism standards for content and ads). When selecting keywords and criteria for paid ads, it was also worthwhile to consider factors of discriminating clients and unequal treatment.

For certain clients, ethical considerations should should rule out cooperation. For example, promoting illegitimate products, spreading disinformation or hurtful information, working with clients that operate in a grey area or promote doubtful services or products (online gambling, propaganda resources, adult web sites, semi-legal services etc).
