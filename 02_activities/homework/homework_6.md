**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

In my previous work and studies related to SQL, my focus was primarily on technical execution and efficiency in data manipulation. However, after reading an article on the national ID system of a particular country, where the database is used to link individuals together and label them in ways that might affect their personal rights, such as childbearing, I have begun to ponder the profound ethical implications of data management practices.

The article illustrated how the ID system's database could potentially label individuals as "infertile," which might impact their marital prospects and social standing. This has prompted me to reflect deeply on how data categorization, labeling, and the ensuing consequences need to be handled with great care.

Firstly, privacy protection is paramount. Moving forward, I plan to implement stronger measures to protect personal privacy in SQL queries and data processing, especially concerning sensitive personal information. I will enhance my methods to anonymize data to prevent potential misuse.

Secondly, the issues of data accuracy and bias are critical areas that require my attention. The accuracy of data directly influences the fairness of the analysis outcomes. Therefore, I will regularly review and correct the data in the databases to ensure its correctness and reflect true fairness. Additionally, I will address potential biases in data collection, striving to eliminate these through technical adjustments and methodological changes.

Moreover, data accessibility and impact assessment will be focal points in my future work. I aim to present data analysis results in formats that are easily understandable to stakeholders without a technical background, enabling them to comprehend the implications of the data. Regular assessments of the social impact of data projects, particularly on vulnerable groups, will ensure that the application of data does not exacerbate social injustices.
