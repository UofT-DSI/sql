**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

In my previous role as a Product Manager and Data Analyst in a product management unit within a 25-year-old IT-focused organization and one of the leading internet service providers, I faced numerous challenges upon entering. 
I joined an organization where individuals had been managing their units for a long time, held significant power, and their right or wrong decisions were to be implemented. To advance my work within the organization, I needed to establish optimal relationships with all members of the organization. Therefore, I decided to use intimacy, kindness, and assistance in problem-solving as my guiding principles.
 I aimed to be sincere, strive to understand the collective opinion, summarize it, and calmly lead it in the direction I believed to be right while bringing others along with me. This path required a considerable amount of time for me to harmonize with others and for them to believe that I was there to help them. 
While we may have had differences, once we believed that our goal was the success of the organization and moved away from individual-centered approaches, we could succeed and bring ourselves closer together. During times of trouble, I also made an effort to communicate openly with others and solve problems collaboratively.
