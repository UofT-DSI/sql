**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.
When reflecting on previous work and considering how ethics and inequity components could be incorporated, it’s essential to start by acknowledging the broader context in which technology, data, and decision-making processes operate. Many of the projects we've undertaken, particularly in fields like database management, product distribution, and algorithm design, often have ethical implications that may not be immediately obvious but are critical to address.

For instance, in the SQL projects, which often involve handling customer data or optimizing product distribution, an ethical lens would compel us to consider data privacy and security, especially regarding personally identifiable information (PII). It would be essential to ask questions like: Are we ensuring that customer data is anonymized? Are our data storage and retrieval systems secure? If our SQL queries result in insights that can inform decision-making, are we aware of the potential biases that might skew those insights? Integrating ethics into this work would mean consistently assessing the data sources for bias and inequity and being mindful of the consequences of our queries and reports.

In projects like the “Circular Table” problem (or similar algorithmic problems), where players need to switch places or optimize seating arrangements, ethics might seem like a secondary concern. However, the design of algorithms that prioritize efficiency, fairness, and non-discrimination is inherently an ethical issue. While the mathematical optimization of swaps might seem neutral, we should also consider whether the algorithm treats all users equally, whether it perpetuates any biases, or whether the problem can be modeled in a way that ensures fairness to all participants.

One concrete example of incorporating ethics is being conscious of potential inequity in resource distribution, as was seen in the CROSS JOIN task. If we were designing a real-world solution for vendor distribution across various markets, we would need to ask whether certain communities are being underserved, whether any systemic biases might affect vendor profitability, or if any regions are consistently disadvantaged in access to products.

Furthermore, ethics also ties into the concept of algorithmic accountability. In SQL queries that impact vendor operations, it’s crucial to ensure that the models and queries used to make decisions don’t disadvantage small businesses or perpetuate inequities between larger and smaller vendors. Transparency in how the models are developed, how data is being used, and providing an opportunity for stakeholders (in this case, vendors) to challenge or question the algorithm’s outputs would help align this work with ethical best practices.

In sum, the adjustments to my previous work would involve building a framework that constantly questions the sources of data, the design of algorithms, and the impacts of the systems we develop on different groups of people. This approach fosters transparency, fairness, and accountability—three crucial pillars of ethical computing that can mitigate inequities in how technology is applied
