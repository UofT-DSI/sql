# "This Cohort"

Welcome to your cohort folder! SQL slides presented in class are found in this folder as well as copies of our in-class code from live-coding sessions.

ðŸš¨**ATTENTION!** During November 2025, both the SGS DC Cohort and Cohort 8 are running in parallel. Please navigate to the appropriate folder for your cohort for live code. 

## Custom Slides

There are two styles of SQL slides, HTML and PDF. Both are generated from R-markdown xarigan files. Below are links to the PDFs:
- [Slides 01](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/sql/blob/main/04_this_cohort/custom_slides/pdf/slides_01.pdf)
- [Slides 02](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/sql/blob/main/04_this_cohort/custom_slides/pdf/slides_02.pdf)
- [Slides 03](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/sql/blob/main/04_this_cohort/custom_slides/pdf/slides_03.pdf)
- [Slides 04](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/sql/blob/main/04_this_cohort/custom_slides/pdf/slides_04.pdf)
- [Slides 05](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/sql/blob/main/04_this_cohort/custom_slides/pdf/slides_05.pdf)
- [Slides 06](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/sql/blob/main/04_this_cohort/custom_slides/pdf/slides_06.pdf)

**Note: For the DC Cohort, we will not use slides 06, however, the content may still be of interest for further self-learning.**
