## Section 2 answers
### # COALESCE
1. Our favourite manager wants a detailed long list of products, but is afraid of tables! We tell them, no problem! We can produce a list with all of the appropriate details. 

Using the following syntax you create our super cool and not at all needy manager a list:
```
SELECT 
product_name || ', ' || product_size|| ' (' || product_qty_type || ')'
FROM product
```

But wait! The product table has some bad data (a few NULL values). 
Find the NULLs and then using COALESCE, replace the NULL with a blank for the first problem, and 'unit' for the second problem. 

**HINT**: keep the syntax the same, but edited the correct components with the string. The `||` values concatenate the columns into strings. Edit the appropriate columns -- you're making two edits -- and the NULL rows will be fixed. All the other rows will remain the same.

```
SELECT 
product_name || ', ' || COALESCE(product_size, '') || ' (' || COALESCE(product_qty_type, 'unit') || ')'
FROM product
```

# Windowed Functions
1. Write a query that selects from the customer_purchases table and numbers each customerâ€™s visits to the farmerâ€™s market (labeling each market date with a different number). Each customerâ€™s first visit is labeled 1, second visit is labeled 2, etc. 

You can either display all rows in the customer_purchases table, with the counter changing on each new market date for each customer, or select only the unique market dates per customer (without purchase details) and number those visits. 
**HINT**: One of these approaches uses ROW_NUMBER() and one uses DENSE_RANK().

`DENSE_RANK`
```
SELECT cp.*,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY market_date) AS visit_number

FROM customer_purchases AS cp

ORDER BY customer_id, market_date
```

`ROW_NUMBER`
```
SELECT customer_id, market_date,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY market_date) AS visit_number

FROM customer_purchases

GROUP BY customer_id, market_date
ORDER BY customer_id, market_date
```

2. Reverse the numbering of the query from a part so each customerâ€™s most recent visit is labeled 1, then write another query that uses this one as a subquery (or temp table) and filters the results to only the customerâ€™s most recent visit.

`DENSE_RANK`
```
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT cp.*,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY market_date DESC) AS visit_number

  FROM customer_purchases AS cp
) x
WHERE x.visit_number =1
ORDER BY customer_id, market_date
```

`ROW_NUMBER`
```
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT customer_id, market_date,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY market_date DESC) AS visit_number

  FROM customer_purchases

  GROUP BY customer_id, market_date
) x
WHERE x.visit_number =1
ORDER BY customer_id, market_date
```

3. Using a COUNT() window function, include a value along with each row of the customer_purchases table that indicates how many different times that customer has purchased that product_id.

```
SELECT cp.*,
COUNT(product_id) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id, product_id) AS
product_purchase_count
FROM customer_purchases AS cp
ORDER BY customer_id, product_id, market_date
```

```
/* running count version */
select customer_id, 
vendor_id, 
product_id, 
market_date, 
transaction_time, 
count() over (partition by customer_id, 
  product_id 
  order by market_date, 
           transaction_time asc) as buy_count
from customer_purchases
order by customer_id, product_id, buy_count;
```

# String manipulations
1. Some product names in the product table have descriptions like "Jar" or "Organic". These are separated from the product name with a hyphen. Create a column using SUBSTR (and a couple of other commands) that captures these, but is otherwise NULL. Remove any trailing or leading whitespaces. Don't just use a case statement for each product! 

| product_name               | description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| Habanero Peppers - Organic | Organic     |

**HINT**: you might need to use INSTR(product_name,'-') to find the hyphens. INSTR will help split the column. 

```
SELECT *, 
CASE WHEN INSTR(product_name,'-') > 0
  THEN LTRIM(RTRIM(SUBSTR(product_name,INSTR(product_name,'-')+1)))
  ELSE NULL END AS description

FROM product
```


# UNION
1. Using a UNION, write a query that displays the market dates with the highest and lowest total sales.

**HINT**: There are a possibly a few ways to do this query, but if you're struggling, try the following: 1) Create a CTE/Temp Table to find sales values grouped dates; 2) Create another CTE/Temp table with a rank windowed function on the previous query to create "best day" and "worst day"; 3) Query the second temp table twice, once for the best day, once for the worst day, with a UNION binding them. 

```
;WITH sales_per_market AS (
SELECT
market_date,
ROUND(SUM(quantity * cost_to_customer_per_qty),2) AS sales

FROM customer_purchases
GROUP BY market_date
)

,market_dates_ranked_by_sales AS (
SELECT
market_date,
sales,
RANK() OVER (ORDER BY sales) AS sales_rank_asc,
RANK() OVER (ORDER BY sales DESC) AS sales_rank_desc

FROM sales_per_market
)
      
SELECT market_date, sales, sales_rank_desc AS sales_rank
FROM market_dates_ranked_by_sales
WHERE sales_rank_asc = 1

UNION

SELECT market_date, sales, sales_rank_desc AS sales_rank
FROM market_dates_ranked_by_sales
WHERE sales_rank_desc = 1
```

### # # Cross Join
1. Suppose every vendor in the `vendor_inventory` table had 5 of each of their products to sell to **every** customer on record. How much money would each vendor make per product? Show this by vendor_name and product name, rather than using the IDs.

**HINT**: Be sure you select only relevant columns and rows. Remember, CROSS JOIN will explode your table rows, so CROSS JOIN should likely be a subquery. Think a bit about the row counts: how many distinct vendors, product names are there (x)? How many customers are there (y). Before your final group by you should have the product of those two queries (x\*y). 

```
SELECT vendor_name, product_name, sum(price)
FROM (
  SELECT DISTINCT
  vendor_name,
  product_name,
  5 * original_price as price

  FROM vendor_inventory vi 
  JOIN vendor v on v.vendor_id = vi.vendor_id
  JOIN product p on p.product_id = vi.product_id
  ) x
CROSS JOIN 
  (SELECT DISTINCT 
  customer_id
  FROM customer)
GROUP BY vendor_name, product_name
```

# INSERT
1. Create a new table "product_units". This table will contain only products where the `product_qty_type = 'unit'`. It should use all of the columns from the product table, as well as a new column for the `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`.  Name the timestamp column `snapshot_timestamp`.

```
CREATE TABLE product_units AS

 SELECT p.*,
   CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS snapshot_timestamp
 FROM product AS p
 WHERE product_qty_type = "unit"
```

2. Using `INSERT`, add a new row to the product_unit table (with an updated timestamp). This can be any product you desire (e.g. add another record for Apple Pie). 
```

INSERT INTO product_units (product_id, product_name,
  product_size, product_category_id, product_qty_type, snapshot_timestamp)
      SELECT
          product_id,
          product_name,
          product_size,
          product_category_id,
          product_qty_type,
          CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
      FROM product AS p
      WHERE product_id = 7
```

# DELETE 
1. Delete the older record for the whatever product you added. 
```
WITH older_record AS
(SELECT product_id
    ,MIN(snapshot_timestamp) AS snapshot_timestamp
    FROM product_units 
    WHERE product_id = 7)

DELETE FROM product_units
WHERE (product_id = 
  (SELECT  product_id 
  FROM older_record
    )
AND snapshot_timestamp =  
  (SELECT  snapshot_timestamp 
  FROM older_record
    ))
```

**HINT**: If you don't specify a WHERE clause, you are going to have a bad time.

# UPDATE
1. We want to add the current_quantity to the product_units table. First, add a new column, `current_quantity` to the table using the following syntax.
```
ALTER TABLE product_units
ADD current_quantity INT;
```

Then, using `UPDATE`, change the current_quantity equal to the **last** `quantity` value from the vendor_inventory details. 

**HINT**: This one is pretty hard. First, determine how to get the "last" quantity per product. Second, coalesce null values to 0 (if you don't have null values, figure out how to rearrange your query so you do.) Third, `SET current_quantity = (...your select statement...)`, remembering that WHERE can only accommodate one column. Finally, make sure you have a WHERE statement to update the right row, you'll need to use `product_units.product_id` to refer to the correct row within the product_units table. When you have all of these components, you can run the update statement.

```
ALTER TABLE product_units
ADD current_quantity INT;

UPDATE product_units
SET current_quantity = (
  SELECT current_quantity 
  FROM (
    SELECT  p.product_id, COALESCE(quantity,0) as current_quantity

    FROM product_units p
    LEFT JOIN (
      SELECT *
      ,ROW_NUMBER() OVER( PARTITION BY vi.product_id ORDER BY market_date DESC) AS rn
      FROM vendor_inventory vi 
    ) vi ON p.product_id  = vi.product_id

    WHERE rn = 1 
    OR rn IS NULL
  ) p
WHERE product_units.product_id = p.product_id);
```
