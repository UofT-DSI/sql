class: top, left, inverse
# Fundamental Three Commands
- Our first three commands (`SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`) are essential to nearly every SQL query

--

- The template for our initial SQL statement is as such:

    `SELECT` : _the columns we want to retrieve_

    `FROM` : _the table we are querying_

    `WHERE` : _filters/conditions (optional)_

    `ORDER BY` : _column sorting: ascending_ `ASC` _or descending_ `DESC` _(optional)_

    `LIMIT` : _how many rows we want to return (optional)_

---

class: top, left, inverse
# Fundamental Three Commands
- Always specified in this order:
  - `SELECT` will come first
  - `FROM` will come after `SELECT`
      - when we are querying more than one table at a time, each will come after `FROM` but before `WHERE` (more on this later)
  - `WHERE` will come after `FROM` 
  - `ORDER BY` will come after `WHERE` clauses

&lt;br&gt;
--

- We'll sometimes use the `LIMIT` clause to look at data
  - This comes at the very end of a query
  - `LIMIT` shouldn't be used for analytics unless you have a specific reason
    - `ORDER BY` often impacts the usefulness of `LIMIT` 

&lt;br&gt;
--

- Remember:
  - In SQL, we use two dashes `--` to comment out lines, rather than `#`
---


class: middle, center, inverse
# Fundamental Three Commands

## **SELECT**

## FROM

## WHERE

---

class: top, left, inverse
# SELECT

- At its simplest `SELECT` specifies column names we are retrieving
  - commas come between each column name
      - `SELECT student, course, grade ...`
  - column names with a space need to be enclosed in square brackets
      - `SELECT [poorly named column], better_column_name, AnotherColumnName`

&lt;br&gt;
--

- Within `SELECT` statements we can perform manipulations on columns
  - e.g. rename a column
      - `SELECT [poorly named column] AS better_col`
  - combine two text columns
  - perform math on a numeric column
  - ...and many more things


---

class: top, left, inverse
# SELECT

- We can use `SELECT` to perform math without a `FROM` statement
  - `SELECT 1 + 1`
  - `SELECT 10*5, cos(2), pi()`

&lt;br&gt;
--

- And we can use `SELECT` to specify constant values
  - `SELECT 2024 AS this_year, 'May' AS this_month`

&lt;br&gt;
--

- When selecting columns, they need to exist in the table!
  
---

# Fundamental Three Commands

## SELECT

## **FROM**

## WHERE

---

class: top, left, inverse
# FROM

- `FROM` statements indicate which table the data is from and where the table is located
  - in more complicated RDBMs, you will often have multiple databases on the same server and multiple schema within those databases
      - a fully qualified location of a table would thus be `database.schema.table`
- `SELECT * FROM table_name` indicates _everything_ in the table

&lt;br&gt;
--

- Best practice suggests that we should explicitly call each column, even if we want all of them
 - **Why do we think this is the case?** ðŸ’­ðŸ’¬**Think, Pair, Share**

# Fundamental Three Commands

## SELECT 

## FROM

## **WHERE**

---
class: top, left, inverse
# WHERE

- `WHERE` clauses are conditions that the query will follow
- When we want to have multiple conditions, we use a single `WHERE` and then additional logical operations

```
    SELECT *
    FROM students
    WHERE first_name = 'Thomas'
    AND last_name = 'Rosenthal'
```

- **Notice we put string values in single quotes**
  - SQLite also allows double quotes, with a few minor caveats

&lt;br&gt;
--

- `WHERE` clauses always return rows evaluating to `TRUE`
  - Follows Boolean rules if more than one condition is present
  
---

class: top, left, inverse
# WHERE

### Logical Operators
- `AND`
- `OR`
- `NOT`
- `NOT IN`
- equals: `=`
- does not equal: `&lt;&gt;` `!=`  
  - (flavour dependent)
- greater than (equal to): `&gt;` `&gt;=` 
- less than (equal to): `&lt;` `&lt;=`
- `BETWEEN`
- `EXISTS`
  - table specific
- `IS`
  - `NULL` specific 
  
---

class: top, left, inverse
# WHERE

### NULL
- `NULL` is not a value (it's the absence of a value)
  - to check null values, we use `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL`
  - `= NULL` will not work

--

### LIKE
- `LIKE` allows for string wildcards
- `%` specifies the wildcard placement
  - `country_name LIKE 'and%'`
      - Andorra
  - `country_name LIKE '%and'`
      - Finland, Iceland ...more
  - `country_name LIKE '%and%'`
      - all of the above, _plus_ Antigua and Barbuda, Netherlands, Rwanda ...more!
  - `country_name LIKE '%an%d%'`
      - Canada ...surely more!

class: middle, center, inverse
# Two More Commands

## **CASE**

## DISTINCT

---

class: top, left, inverse
# CASE
- `CASE` statements allow us to introduce conditional logic into our `SELECT` statements

--

- They are generally similar to `if` or `if else` statements in python, R, and other languages
  - When a condition is introduced, we check whether it evaluates to TRUE
      - If it is true, we proceed with a desired command, calculation, value, etc
      - If it is not true, we move to the next condition
          - If it is true, we proceed with another desired command, calculation, value, etc
              - ...all the way until we run out of conditions
  - For all FALSE conditions, we can use an `ELSE` statement if we want to

--

- The results of a `CASE` statement will be a new column
- Best practice is to name the new column using `AS new_column_name`

```
    CASE 
      WHEN [something is true]
        THEN [value or calculation]
      WHEN [something else is true]
        THEN [value or calcuation]
      ELSE [value or calcuation]
    END 
```

## CASE

## **DISTINCT**

---

class: top, left, inverse
# DISTINCT
- Not all queries will result in unique rows (i.e. duplicates are present)
  - **Can we think of why this is? Write your thoughts in the etherpad!**

&lt;br&gt;
--

- `DISTINCT` has two possible spots within a query:
  - One comes immediately after `SELECT`, before column names are specified
      - e.g. `SELECT DISTINCT songs, albums, artists...`
      - This `DISTINCT` will govern the entire query
      
  - The other comes within aggregation (we'll get to this later)
      - e.g. `COUNT(DISTINCT products)`
      - This `DISTINCT` will only affect this specific aggregation

---

class: top, left, inverse
# Putting Things Together with JOIN

- Joins are used to combine data stored in different tables into a single table

--

- Joins are the "Cartesian product" of two tables with _conditional selection(s)_ of specific rows
  - A Cartesian product combines all possible row values with another 
    - An easy example is a deck of cards:
      
      combining four suits: 
      {â™ , â™¥, â™¦, â™£} 
      
      with thirteen ranks:
      {A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2}
      
      produces 52 cards (4 * 13)
      
  - To create a Cartesian Product in SQL we use `CROSS JOIN` (rare, but not unheard of)

---
class: top, left, inverse
# Putting Things Together with JOIN

- Joins require relationships (with one exception, `CROSS JOIN`) between tables
- Different joins create different results
  - Join names specify which conditional selection is desired

&lt;br&gt;
--

- There are three join types in SQL but different joining criteria can further limit results 
- The most permitting join is a `FULL OUTER JOIN` and the least permitting is an `INNER JOIN`
  - Let's explore what this means by looking at each of them


---

class: top, left, inverse
# Putting Things Together with JOIN

### JOIN Syntax

Syntax for a join is as follows:

```
SELECT [columns]

FROM [left table]
	
JOIN [right table]
	
ON [left table.matching column] = [right table.matching column]
```

--

A couple of notes:

- You will need to specify which join type is desired:
  - e.g. `INNER JOIN`
- Matching columns do not need to have the same name, just the same value
  - e.g. `ON table1.LetterGrade = table2.Alphabet` will work because A=A, B=B, C=C, etc
- You can specify more than one column to be joined
  - e.g. `ON table1.FirstName = table2.FirstName AND table1.LastName = table2.LastName`

---

class: top, left, inverse
# INNER JOIN
- `INNER JOIN` filters both tables to rows present in both tables
- `INNER JOIN` does not produce `NULL` values
- `INNER JOIN` is the "default" join
  - i.e. queries do not need to specify "INNER", though it's good practice to write INNER

class: top, left, inverse
# INNER JOIN

A quick note on table aliasing:
- It is very common practice to alias table names 
  - It makes join criteria much more concise
  - It simplifies `SELECT` statements when column names are the same
    - This is a common error: _"ambiguous column name"_
      - SQL requires you to specify _which_ table you are returning the result from
- Generally, tables are aliased with the first letter (or first few letters) of the table so they can be easily referenced
  - `product AS p`
  - `product_category AS pc`

## INNER JOIN

## **LEFT (OUTER) JOIN**

## RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN

## FULL (OUTER) JOIN

## Multiple Table Joins

---

class: top, left, inverse
# LEFT (OUTER) JOIN
- `LEFT JOIN` filters the "right" table to rows present in the "left" table
- `LEFT JOIN` will most often produce `NULL` values
- The "OUTER" in `LEFT OUTER JOIN` is optional
  - Generally, OUTER seems to be excluded, but both are correct
- LEFT _is not_ optional; there is no "OUTER JOIN"

---

class: top, left, inverse
# RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN
- `RIGHT JOIN` filters the "left" table to rows present in the "right" table
- `RIGHT JOIN` will most often produce `NULL` values
- The "OUTER" in `RIGHT OUTER JOIN` is optional
  - Generally, OUTER seems to be excluded, but both are correct
- `RIGHT JOIN` is somewhat frowned upon, but sometimes they make sense
  - Often your query can be reorganized to use a `LEFT JOIN` instead
    - SQLite does not currently support `RIGHT JOIN`

## INNER JOIN

## LEFT (OUTER) JOIN

## RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN

## **FULL (OUTER) JOIN**

## Multiple Table Joins

---

class: top, left, inverse
# FULL (OUTER) JOIN
- `FULL OUTER JOIN` does not filter either "left" or "right" table
- Expect `NULL` values to be produced from a `FULL OUTER JOIN`
- My experience has been to write `FULL OUTER JOIN` rather than `FULL JOIN` but this is personal preference
- Annoyingly, SQLite does not support `FULL OUTER JOIN` (_it really should_), but there is a workaround to produce the results

--

### Filtering a FULL (OUTER) JOIN
- All OUTER JOIN syntax can be filtered to exclude the _matching_ criteria
  - Often called an ANTI JOIN, i.e. what's _not_ in the other table

```
    SELECT *
    FROM table_1
    {LEFT | RIGHT | FULL} OUTER JOIN table_2
    ON table_1.key = table_2.key
    WHERE {table_1.key IS NULL | table_2.key IS NULL | 
           table_1.key IS NULL OR table_2.key IS NULL}
```

---

class: top, left, inverse
# Multiple Table Joins
- More than one table can be joined at a time

```
    SELECT *
    FROM table_1
    {INNER | LEFT | FULL JOIN table_2
      ON table_1.key = table_2.key
    {INNER | LEFT | FULL JOIN table_3
      ON {table_1 | table_2}.key = table_3.key
    {INNER | LEFT | FULL JOIN table_n
      ON {table_1 | table_2 | table_3}.key = table_n.key

```

--

- The order and type of joins will have significant effect on the final table
- It's important to determine which table should be the `FROM` table

&lt;br&gt;

- Sometimes you have to experiment a bit to get things right
- **Can you imagine scenarios based on your knowledge of different `JOIN` types that result in significantly different outputs?**
